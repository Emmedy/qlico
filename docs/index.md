# Welcome to the Qlico documentation

Qlico is an open-source project that makes it easier to run your (web) project
inside Docker, at the moment itâ€™s just a set of configuration files.

It aims to accelerate development teams by using Docker in their development
workflow by using a hassle-free Docker stack.

## Why should I use Qlico instead of X?

* Easy configuration, just pick the parts you'll need
* Easy to use your own configuration files
* Easy to extend
* Close to the default `docker-compose` experience but everything is tested
* When using `qlico` in a team, you can use defaults in your project
  configurations, for example `postgres13` for PostgreSQL 13, `percona8` for
  Percona 8, etc.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker >= 20.10](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose >= 1.28](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [dnsmasq (optional, but recommended)](dnsmasq.md)

## Getting started

To start using Qlico please use the [Quick start](quick-start.md).

## History

Qlico started as a "side" project in 2017, we were using multiple Dockerfiles (for
PHP 5, PHP 7, etc.), and mounting all the projects inside one webserver (Apache).
This was really slow (on macOS), and it was not possible to change the PHP
version per project, all the projects were using php5, php7 or something else
depending on the url.

This has helped us to adopt Docker in our development workflow, but after a
while the old stack was not maintainable anymore, that's when [Tom](https://github.com/TomKeur) decided to
create a new stack with a smaller footprint, and easier to update.

Qlico was born.

## The name Qlico?

In the Netherlands there are plastic trash cans, called Kliko's. Because these
are "containers", and we're using a lot of containers inside of
Docker/Kubernetes, the name Qlico was used. Since naming things is hard ;-).

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

## Qlico in production?

Qlico can be used in development and in production. Just use the `prod` stage of the `Dockerfile` inside your project.
Multiple companies are running Qlico in production (in a Kubernetes cluster) without any problems!
